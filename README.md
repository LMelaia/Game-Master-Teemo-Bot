# Teeto Bot

## A simple Discord bot created as a joke for a personal/private discord server.

The bot provides a couple joke commands and the ability to
sit in a channel and repeatedly play the same song.

## Important
The bot requires 5 external dependencies in the same
folder as the executable.
These dependencies allow the bot to play audio
in a discord channel:

 * libopus.dll (as opus.dll)
 * libopus.dll.checksums (as opus.dll.checksums)
 * libsodium.dll
 * libsodium.dll.checksums
 * ffmpeg.exe
